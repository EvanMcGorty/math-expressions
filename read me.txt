expressions.h is the main file to include.
you may include memory_leak_finder.h which contains a global that dumps detected memory leaks upon destruction.
definitions.h is part of the implementation and already included by expressins.h, but you may want to reference it.
listmaking.h and expression_tree_utils.h are utilities for manipulating expressions that are optional to be included. They are also decent example code.
how to use expressions.docx is a tutorial.
everything else (in the implementation folder) is part of the implementation

strict aliasing must be off!
